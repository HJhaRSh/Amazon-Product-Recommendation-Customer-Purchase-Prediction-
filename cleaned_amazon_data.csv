This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad.

After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there.

These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess I'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  They're ok but not worth all that money.,0

For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.

Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.

They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.,0

Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not.

The difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side.  I liked that about it.  While it was sweet it wasn't syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste.  Also it had a much more juicy aspect to it.  Its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison I can make is it's like one of those fruity V8 juices only carbonated.

This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch.

It helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it.<br /><br />The price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder.

And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too.

Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.

I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.,1

After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.,1

And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too.

Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :),1
12157,458,4540,Peggy /G,1,2,1,1251072000,Not so sure because,I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied brands of dehydrated chicken breast (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?,0

14124,1041,3981,"""W. Dietrich """"WD""""""",0,1,4,1298246400,Treat size is a little on the large size,It is hard to review a product that was meant for a dog but I will give it a try.  The first thing upon opening up the resealable package is that the treats are a little on the large size and seem to be meant to break in half as there is a line down the middle that allows you to snap in two.  These should not be considered training treats because they are much too big to feed to your dog several times a day.  I did smell them before giving them to the dogs and the smell seemed fresh and reminded me of a regular cookie which is what they resemble.<br /><br />Now for taste I left that to the dogs.  I have two dogs a Schipperkie and a Mini Aussie that are given treats twice a day plus training treats.  They only eat the finest products which are fresh from the dog bakery or a gourment dog treat store so it is safe to say the dogs are somewhat pickey.  When I first gave the treats they both took them from me and ran off to enjoy. Now it is important to note that when they get a really special treat they each go to there favorite place to enjoy and keep the other dog from stealing the treat.  In this case the dogs ate their treats next to each other so I am going to assume they did not feel that the treat was all that special.  Next I put the Newman Treat in the bowl with a cookie that smells like a pizza from the dog bakery.  One dog took the Newman cookie first and the other dog took the pizza cookie first which was smaller than the Newman treat.  The dogs digested the food properly after checking as the poop size was normal after a week of using the Newman product as their daily treats.<br /><br />All in all I wish the product was sold in a smaller size but the quality of the treat seemed to be good and the dogs liked the treats but I dont feel they loved them (as I mentioned before they did not go to their special place to eat the treats in piece and quite as they will do on their favorite treats).,1

It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.,1
